## Preface 
Our team of data scientists working at Movies Legit are always looking for new innovations to push the company forward.
Our current recommender system Movie-Legit 1.0 has turned us into one of the leaders in the Movie Based Recommender Industry, but our competition is quickly catching up. 
Our vice president Skylar English gave us the task of trying to improve on his model. We want to update our recommender system so small start-ups like Netflix and Amazon don't bypass our trusted recommendations and make our service obsolete.

## Objectives

1)  Improve on the current recommender system, to increase user trust and keep visitors coming back to our website.
2)  Devise a way to recommend movies to brand new visitors and provide them with great selections that will keep them coming back to the Recommender System. 

## more accurate predictions => better user experience => users recommend to friends => customer base grows


## Process 

Taking our current data base of about 100,000 ratings, we created an algorithm that iterates through our well established customer base and recommends movies based on previous movie ratings and how they relate to movies that a customer.


Welcoming new users is a challenge that we haven't fully lived up to in the past. Sure Movies-Legit is a great recommender system for existing customers and the current algorithm has done a great job to cater to them. But we lack the capability to welcome new users quickly and without the hassle of rating a bunch of movies before getting good recommendations.  


Welcome to the 21st century of recommender systems...
