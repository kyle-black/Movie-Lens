### Movies-Legit 2.0

## Preface 
Our team of data scientists working at Movies Legit are always looking for new innovations to push the company foward.
Our current reccomender system Movie-Legit 1.0 has turned us into one of the leaders in the Movie Based Reccomender Industry, but our competition is quickly catching up. We want to update our reccomender system so small start-ups like Netflix and Amazon don't bypass our trusted reccomendations.

## Objectives

1)  Improve on the current Reccomender System, to increase user trust and keep vistors coming back to our website.
2)  Devise a way to reccomend movies to brand new visitors and provide them with great selections that will keep them coming back to the Reccomender System. 


## Process 

Taking our current data base of about 100,000 customers, we created an algorithm that iterates through our well established customer base and reccomends movies based on previous movie ratings and how they relate to movies that a customer. This new algorthim is more math intensive but will provide movie results in the same time Movies-Legit 1.0.


Taking on New Customers is a challegne that we haven't fully lived up to in the past. Sure Movies-Legit is a great reccomender system for existing customers and the current algorithm has done a great job to cater to existing customers. But we lack the capabilities to welcome new users, a quick way to get the movie a new customer wants without having to rate a bunch of new movies. 


We think this will bring our company into the 21 century of reccomnder system.
